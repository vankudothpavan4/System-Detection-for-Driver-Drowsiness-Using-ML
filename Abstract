1. Components of the System
Input Data:

    Camera Feed: Captures real-time video or images of the driverâ€™s face.
    Sensors (Optional): EEG, heart rate, or steering pattern sensors for additional physiological data.

Features Monitored:

    Eye Features:
        Blink rate and duration.
        Percentage of Eye Closure (PERCLOS) over time.
    Facial Features:
        Head pose and orientation.
        Yawning frequency.
    Behavioral Patterns:
        Frequent nodding or drooping head.
        Sudden steering changes.

2. Workflow

    Preprocessing:
        Image enhancement (grayscale conversion, noise reduction).
        Face detection using algorithms like Haar cascades or DNNs (Deep Neural Networks).

    Feature Extraction:
        Eye and mouth region detection using landmarks (e.g., dlib or OpenCV).
        Calculate PERCLOS and detect yawning.

    Classification:
        Use machine learning models (e.g., SVM, CNNs) to classify drowsy vs. alert states.

    Alert Mechanism:
        Audio alert (buzzer or spoken message).
        Visual alert on the dashboard.
        Vehicle control systems (e.g., slowing down or stopping the vehicle).

3. Outputs

    Real-Time Alerts:
        Audio: "Drowsiness detected, please take a break."
        Visual: Warning sign (e.g., red flashing icon).

    Metrics Display:
        Eye closure percentage.
        Drowsiness level (low, moderate, critical).

    Data Logging:
        Timestamped records of detected drowsy events.
        Driver behavior analytics over time.

4. Images for System Visualization

    Image 1: Real-time video frame with detected facial landmarks (e.g., bounding boxes around eyes and mouth).
    Image 2: Graph or chart showing PERCLOS values over time.
    Image 3: Dashboard alert interface with warnings.
    Image 4: Heatmap of attention across the face.
